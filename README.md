# TeachingMyselfVBnet
I've never used VB.Net before, but I do have some experience in C#.Net. 
So, in preparation for an interview where .Net (partiularly VB) and Desktop Applications are used, I have made a simple project to do just that!


There is no goal here other than messing around with Visual Basic and .Net to make a simple desktop application.
